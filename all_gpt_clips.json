It's impacting the amygdala where emotions come from. And it's creating this emotional resonance loop. That's part of how the mother and the baby bond. So that right eye to left eye contact is the most bonding eye contact that you can have with someone. Now you could say, oh, but my mum was left handed or you could be left handed.

Maybe there was going to be a spell of the Ice Age and they would all freeze to death, or they wouldn't have food. He needed to make sure that at least five women were impregnated with his sperm at the same time. So that if there was a food shortage or there was like stillbirth or miscarriage or whatever, at least one out of five would survive.

So let's say that I give you that list of signs and symptoms that you've got high levels of cortisol, which include things like sleep disruption because cortisol is part of the 24 hour clock. Melatonin helps us to wake up. Cortisol helps. Melatonin helps us to fall asleep. Cortisol helps us to wake up. Maybe you've noticed the belly fat. Because of the really strong connection between the brain and the gut, any sort of reflux or indigestion symptoms are often signs that you've got high levels of cortisol too. And of course, things like irritability and mood changes. What I mostly would hear people say is that I can just about keep it together when I'm at work. But when I get home, if my kids are, you know, annoying or my partner's asking for too much, I just snap. So that means you're like one step away from snapping at work if somebody pushes you too far.

One is physical exercise because you can literally sweat cortisol out of your body. You can sweat excess cortisol out of your body by doing aerobic exercise. The other one is journaling. So writing out what's on your mind rather than just let it be in there and keep going round and round. Or if you've got a therapist or a trusted friend speaking it out loud.

    "transcript_text": "And the reason is, we've always known that when you sleep, you lay down your memories and new learning. You process your emotions, the cells in the body regenerate themselves. We've known that for a long time. That's never really been enough for these very driven CE-level people to want to give up eight hours a night to sleep. If they feel they can get by on four or five, then they'll rather do that because they've got so much to do. The ideal is eight hours and 15 minutes in population norm studies. So that doesn't mean it's for everyone, but for most people, that's the ideal. Actually, sleeping more than that can be depressogenic, so it can start to lower your mood. So you don't want to really be sleeping for nine plus hours, but you ideally need to be in bed for nine hours to get that amount of sleep. And so there was some award-winning research around 2012 to 2014 when we were beginning to understand how important the cleaning of the brain is overnight. So this entirely new system that we didn't know existed, which is called the glymphatic system. It's like the lymphatic system in your body, but it's to do with glial cells, so it was named the glymphatic system. That system is a very active kind of waterway channel cleansing system of the brain."

So the exact things that we see in the pathology of dementing diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, like tau proteins and amyloid plaques and neurofibrilla rectangles. How do you say that in English? Those things are being flushed out of the brain very actively overnight. And that process takes seven to eight hours to complete the cleaning. That's why you need to be in bed for eight to nine hours. So it takes seven or eight hours of restorative sleep or just being in bed? Just sleep, not in bed. If you're in bed awake, you're not asleep. You have to be asleep, but you'll go through the different sleep cycles every 90 minutes. This isn't in time with that.

And so it's color-coded for whether you're doing light exercise, heavy exercise, whether you're stressed, or whether you're recouping resilience. And mostly people recoup resilience overnight, but you could clearly see with people with young children, you could see when they were woken up overnight because it would go into stress. Some people recoup resilience during the day if, let's say you're with your partner or your sibling and you're just sitting together and it's super relaxed, or if you love your job, you can see that happening during the day as well. But because I am so obsessed with my sleep, I wouldn't normally welcome any sleep disturbance. But the power of sleeping together and cuddling all night is so neuroprotective that I would encourage everybody to do it."

And I walked away, got on the taxi and left, whatever. And she said to me the same day or the day after, she went, I don't know what happened there, but it unlocks something in me.

If you had a hundred people in a room, 50 men and 50 women, and you asked them to line up in order of height, not all the men would be taller than all the women. In the middle, there'd be a bit of a mixture. And it's like that with the brain and intuition and everything else. So yeah, there are some, there's some disparity.

If you haven't been doing exercise for a while and then you start the rate of cell turnover is like 30%. So it increases after a period of inactivity with new aerobic exercise.
