Yeah, I found this out many years ago. And it has completely changed my perception on so many things. So many things, because I have to be honest, I'm a very sort of logical, I need like science and evidence. And so I always thought about, I don't know, physical physical things. Like if I can't see it, it doesn't exist. Kind of been my framework for thinking about life. And when I heard about that, I checked it was true, found out it was true. And it broke the frame in which I think because if if there are invisible, if it's possible, that invisible forces now between me and you are interacting with our bodies, I go, what else is possible?"

Well, one of the side effects is quite funny, is that as a survival mechanism, it will help you to store fat around your abdomen. So, you know, again, in the cave, if you were potentially going to like not find food for a month, then if you had extra fat around your abdomen, you could digest that and survive until you could find food. So with my clients and financial services, it got to a point where as soon as I walked into the room, they just lift their T-shirt up and say, now you know how I've been in the last month. And then I had a really, really funny incident when I was speaking at a bank and the CEO's PA was there in the audience. And I was explaining that, you know, leadership stress leaks down, that that stress can lead to abdominal fat that you can't shift. And she shouted out, so he's the reason that I'm fat."

We need that. And that can be a good thing. But that should be a spike. It should go up and it should go back down again. If it stays high all the time, that's not good."
