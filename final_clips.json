They just sat there and they visualized themselves lifting weights. They had a 13% increase in muscle mass. People should realize how much potential they have in their brains. Dr Tara Swart. She's a neuroscientist, medical doctor, executive advisor, and best-selling author."

    "transcript_text": "Yeah, of course it is. I think we might go down that path a little bit. But the reason that works is because there's association in our brains that if someone is looking into your left eye, it kind of triggers something, a bonding response that is quite innate in us."

    "transcript_text": "Up eight hours a night to sleep you know it's if they feel they can get by on four or five then they'll rather do that because they've got so much to do. The ideal is eight hours and 15 minutes in population norm studies so that doesn't mean it's for everyone but for most people that's the ideal. Actually sleeping more than that can be depressogenic so it can start to lower your mood so you don't want to really be sleeping for nine plus hours but you ideally need to be in bed for nine hours to get that amount of sleep and so there was some award-winning research around 2012 to 2014 when we were beginning to understand how important the cleaning of the brain is overnight. So this entirely new system that we didn't know existed which is called the glymphatic system."

    "transcript_text": "So this could clearly see when they were woken up overnight because it would go into stress. Some people recoup resilience during the day if you know let's say you're like with your partner or your sibling and you're just sitting together and it's super relaxed or if you love your job you know that you can see that happening during the day as well but because I am so obsessed with my sleep I wouldn't normally welcome any sleep disturbance but the power of sleeping together and cuddling all night is so neuroprotective that I would encourage everybody to do it if they can."
